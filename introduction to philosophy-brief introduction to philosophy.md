### History of Philosophy
In this section I will walk you into the history of Philosophy, History of Philosophy is a whole new subject
of study in Philosophy, There's thousands book's about it and hardworking writers and thinkers around it.

> The history of philosophy is the systematic study of the development of philosophical thought. It focuses on philosophy as rational inquiry based on argumentation but some theorists also include myths, religious traditions, and proverbial lore.
***Says Wikipedia***

There is a debate about which the mythical or religious myths is a part of history of philosophy or not,
indeed I will include the religious and mythical part of philosophy in this article.

## Western
Let's start with the Western philosophy, One of the most important and most influential's of philosophy
were Western philosophers, Such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle.

I'm sure you heard some of these names at least once, The Western philosophy has many categories each in
separate timelines, but I will only include the ancient Greek philosophy at 469â€“399 BCE.

### Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
The philosophy of Socrates and Plato is built on Presocratic (which is not mentioned in this article) philosophy
Socrates did not write any thoughts about the philosophy, But his students and contemporaries write down the Philosophy
of Socrates. He was not focused on mythical philosophy despite Presocratic has many thoughts on mythical philosophy
the philosophy Socrates is pretty strait forward, They start with a single and simple question, and extend to the
underlying ideas and assumptions, It has been said from the history scientist's that the people of ancient Greek, where
upset about the way Socrates described his philosophy, They said that he was asking so many questions and not answering any of them.
